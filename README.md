# SentimentAnalysisTwitter
A small program to determine sentiment over a topic on Twitter, using TextBlob and tweepy.
This app has tokens that I generated for this app on Twitter, and they aren't of much concern to me.
Before using this library, you need to install tweepy, and textblob. Both can be installed using the following command on your terminal:
[pip install textblob tweepy]
I wrote this program for Python 3, but barring the print() statement changes, this should work just fine with Python 2 as well.
